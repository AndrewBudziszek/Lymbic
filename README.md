# Simulation of Variable Attention(SOVA)

### About
Simulation of Variable Attention(SOVA) is an attempt to provide ADHD screening to those that cannot afford to see a doctor to get diagnosed. SOVA, while a great initial screen for ADHD, is not a concrete diagnosis and all results should be reviewed by your doctor to help find the treatment plan that works best for you.

### Research
SOVA uses the research done by the University of Minnesota in their development of the T.O.V.A.(Test of Variables of Attention) test. The TOVA test uses geometric stimuli to measure different aspects of attention. Like the TOVA test, SOVA will use two test conditions: target infrequent, and target frequent. In the first half of the test, where stimuli is infrequent, the target:non-target ratio is 1:3.5. That means that a target is presented once every 3.5 non-target presentations. The first half is designed to make you tired by being boring. It requires a lot of attention since the target is hardly presented. 

There are three different measurements that can be observed during this test:
* An error of omission - the participant does not respond to the target. An error of omission is a measure of inattention.
* An error of commission - the participant responds to a non-target. An error of commission is a measure of impulsivity.
* Hit Rate Variability - This is the consistency in the time in which a participant responds to a target. This is a measure of inattention.
### Technology
SOVA records responses using the participant's keyboard.

The mode of response is an important factor that affects the test's reliability. Many, continuous performance tests use keyboard based input to respond to stimuli. This can cause inherent issues with measurement of time to respond. This test, however, compensates for the average input delay that modern USB keyboards have (~30ms). Even with this delay, we can still make assumptions based on our data as all delay will be similar across hardware. SOVA aims to bring this test to all without the need of special hardware.

Unlike the T.O.V.A. test that uses the participants thumb to record responses, the SOVA encourages using your index finger to record responses. The index finger has the fastest and most consistent reaction time of all digits.

### The Test
The SOVA test is 21 minutes and 48 seconds long. 


### Cost
The average cost of getting diagnosed with ADHD is unaffordable for many people. 
* Initial Consult - $250
* 45 Minute Session x3 or more - $495+
* Follow Up Tests - $100

This is flat out unattainable for many that need help. This test costs a fraction of what you might pay at a Psychologist's office.
